# 02456_Group_44_DDPM_Project

The project is to re-implement the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) in PyTorch and reproduce their results at least on MNIST and ideally on CIFAR-10. This paper is the one that kicked off the diffusion movement, it is a great way to learn what diffusion is all about and have hands-on experience. Link to paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239.
